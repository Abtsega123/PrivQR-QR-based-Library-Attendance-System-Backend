## About

The QR-based Library Attendance System Backend provides the server-side functionality for a system that allows library users to scan QR codes placed in the library premises to register their attendance. The system captures and records attendance data, which can be used for various purposes, including analytics and reporting.

## Demo

Provide a link to a live demo of your system if available. You can also include screenshots or GIFs to showcase its functionality.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the QR-based Library Attendance System Backend on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) with a database created for this project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-attendance-system-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd library-attendance-system-backend
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure the database connection by editing the `.env` file. Provide the necessary database connection details.

5. Run database migrations to create the required tables:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

6. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Describe how users, administrators, or other systems can interact with the QR-based Library Attendance System Backend. Explain the API endpoints, authentication requirements, and any other relevant details.

For example, you might include information about:

- How to generate QR codes for library locations.
- How users can scan QR codes to register attendance.
- How administrators can view attendance reports.

## API Documentation

If your backend provides a RESTful API, document the API endpoints, request and response formats, and any authentication mechanisms used.

For example:

- `POST /api/auth/login`: User login.
- `POST /api/attendance/register`: Register attendance using a QR code.
- `GET /api/reports/attendance`: Get attendance reports.

Include example requests and responses to help users understand how to interact with the API.

## Database Schema

Provide an overview of the database schema, including tables, relationships, and data models used in the backend.
